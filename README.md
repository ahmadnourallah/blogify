## Description

Built with modular Express.js and type-safe TypeScript, Blogify is a blogging RESTFul API that offers all you need to start blogging: posts, comments and categories.

Blogify is highly scalable and customizable, thanks to the unopinionated nature of Express.js. It supports role-based, JWT authentication and thumbnail (image) upload.

Blogify is built to be easily integrated into and used with any frontend system effortlessly. Also, it is thoroughly documented with Swagger UI (check out the live docs
[here](http://blog-api-shef.onrender.com/docs)).

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmadnourallah/blogify
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Before starting the server, you should make sure to define the following environment variables:

-   `PORT`: The port which the development server will listen on. **Default:** `3000`.
-   `DB_URL`: The postgresql url of the database. A postgresql database url has the following format: `postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/database`.
-   `JWT_SECRET`: A confidential cryptographic key used to sign and verify JWTs for authentication. You can generate a random one using: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'));"`.
-   `JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME`: The period after which a generated JWT expires and has to be resigned. **Default:** `2d`.
-   `ADMIN_EMAIL`: The autogenerated superuser's email. By running `npm run seed`, an admin account is generated using the values of this variable and the following ones. **Default**: `admin@gmail.com`.
-   `ADMIN_PASS`: The autogenerated superuser's password. **Default**: `admin123!`.
-   `ADMIN_NAME`: The autogenerated superuser's name. **Default**: `Admin`.

**WARNING:** Do NOT use the default values of `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASS` in production.

### Deployment

You can fire up the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Building the application can be done by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build through:

```bash
npm run start
```

Moreover, you can use `npm run purge` to empty all tables and `npm run seed` to create the default admin account.
